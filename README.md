# Windows10-Community
This is a repo for collecting, organizing, and cataloging issues and suggestions for Windows 10. This repo is for the Windows 10 community and a way to organize feedback, separate from the Microsoft curated Feedback Hub 

# Who is running this?
This repo will be ran by the Windows 10 Community of users and enthusiasts. This is not an official Microsoft project.

# Why? Windows 10 has the Feedback Hub
The Feedback Hub is a great place where users can report errors and submit suggestions to the team at Microsoft. However, there is not a good way to discuss, label, filter, and track issues as they progress. When browsing the Feedback Hub there is an overwhelming amount of information. Some issues are closed, some are old, some are planned, some are ignored, but it is very hard to see what is going on with the current build of Windows.

Hopefully this repo will be a place where people can come to understand how Windows 10 is progressing. What to expect in the next version of Windows 10 and when/how their issues are being addressed.

Each issue should link to existing Feedback Hub posts, or create them if they do not yet exist.

# Will this make a difference? Won't Microsoft just ignore this too?
Organizing and communicating is always the first step toward making a change. The Feedback Hub can be fairly disorganized and hard to coordinate around a specific issue people are seeing with Windows 10. Ideally this repo will be a place where a serious effort can be placed on coordinating around important issues and make sure they don't get forgotten or swept under the rug.
